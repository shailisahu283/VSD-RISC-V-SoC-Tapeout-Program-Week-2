# VSD-RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program-Week-2
###  BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

## üìå Objective

The goal of Week 2 is to build a strong foundation in **System-on-Chip (SoC) fundamentals** and gain hands-on experience with **functional modelling** using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** and **GTKWave**.

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

* Explain the basics of SoC design and its components.
* Understand why BabySoC is used as a simplified model for learning.
* Perform functional modelling of BabySoC using simulation tools.
* Analyze and document simulation results (waveforms & logs).

### üîπ What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** integrates all the essential components of a computer or electronic system into a single chip. It typically includes:

* **CPU/Core** ‚Äì for computation and instruction execution
* **Memory** ‚Äì SRAM, DRAM, cache storage
* **Peripherals** ‚Äì timers, UART, GPIOs, communication interfaces
* **Interconnect/Bus** ‚Äì data pathways connecting components

### üîπ Why BabySoC?

BabySoC is a simplified model that:

* Introduces SoC concepts without overwhelming complexity
* Allows learners to practice simulation, debugging, and waveform analysis
* Serves as a stepping stone before RTL design and physical design

### üîπ Role of Functional Modelling

* Functional modelling verifies **logical correctness** of the design before implementation.
* Helps visualize dataflow, reset behavior, and clocking.
* Provides confidence before moving to RTL and physical stages.

üìÑ **Deliverable (Theory):**
A concise write-up (1‚Äì2 pages) summarizing SoC fundamentals and BabySoC‚Äôs role in learning SoC design.

### üîπ Tools Required

* **[Icarus Verilog (iverilog)](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)** ‚Üí For compiling Verilog code
* **[GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)** ‚Üí For viewing simulation waveforms

### üîπ Steps Performed

1. Clone the BabySoC project repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemanthkumardm/SFAL-VSD-SoC-Journey.git
   cd SFAL-VSD-SoC-Journey/12.\ VSDBabySoC\ Project
   ```

2. Compile the BabySoC Verilog modules:

   ```bash
   iverilog -o babySoc_sim BabySoC_tb.v BabySoC.v
   ```

3. Run the simulation and generate `.vcd` file:

   ```bash
   vvp babySoc_sim
   ```

4. Open the `.vcd` file in GTKWave:

   ```bash
   gtkwave dump.vcd
   ```

5. Analyze the following:

   * ‚úÖ **Reset Operation** ‚Äì verify initialization behavior
   * ‚úÖ **Clocking** ‚Äì check clock waveform and synchronization
   * ‚úÖ **Dataflow** ‚Äì trace signal interactions between modules

### üîπ Deliverables

* **Simulation logs** (`.out` / `.log`)
* **GTKWave screenshots** showing correct BabySoC behavior
* **Short explanations** for each screenshot (e.g., reset sequence, clock signals, data transfer)
